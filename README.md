# Brick and Mortar Business Sales Insights 



ðŸš€ Iâ€™m Excited to share a recent project where I developed an interactive Sales Insights Dashboard using Power BI! This tool is designed to transform complex transaction and customer data into actionable insights, aiding in smarter decision-making processes. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what we achieved:
âœ… Seamless Integration: Pulled data directly from a SQL database to ensure that our insights are always based on the most recent information.
âœ… Real-Time Analytics: Developed a dashboard that updates continuously, providing real-time insights into key Sales Insights metrics and customer behaviours. 
âœ… Enhanced Decision Making: Streamlined data processing and analysis to monitor trends and performance metrics, which have been instrumental in shaping strategic decisions.
âœ… Stakeholder Engagement: Regularly shared insights with internal stakeholders, providing them with a clear view of our performance and areas for improvement.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
The management team needs to be able to track Top KPIs such as Total Revenue, Sales Amount, Profit, Sales Qty. This will help them ensure and identify any anomalies and take corrective actions. 

Besides this, the management needs a report to compare regional performance, analyze Revenue trends, and identify high-value customers.

## ðŸ“Œ Solution:
A detailed report which will help answer all of the management's questions. 

âœ… Top KPIs Dashboard can be used by top-level management to make macro organization-level decisions.
âœ… Management can access the In-depth Performance Analysis like Top Customers, Products, Worst Performing Products and Total revenue by market cities which ultimately substantiate them to take Efficient Decision Making.
